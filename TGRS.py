        This **Music Recommender System** is built using **Python** and has incorporated the use
        **user-based collaborative filtering**. It recommends tracks to users by finding users with
        similar listening histories, calculating predicted interest scores for each track based on those similarities,
        and then ranking the tracks by their predicted interest scores.
        The system uses a combination of a **similarity matrix** and
        **K Nearest Neighbors** to find similar users and recommend tracks they enjoyed.
        
        ### Key Features:
        - Personalized recommendations
        - Upload your own music dataset(Provided that the file contains all columns present in the default file)
        - Data exploration tools
        - Visuals to track the distribution of user activity
